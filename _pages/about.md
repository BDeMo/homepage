 Here's the page (academic CV, [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTgxe9sfr3W7eJkx89dlQl7VlkzxBhGf/view?usp=sharing)) about Mingjia (Samuel Jayden) Shi, 石明佳 in Chinese. An ENFP who shouldn't say too much, but especially wants to. If you think the one in the sidebar is too casual, I have a [formal version](images/a_pic_of_mine_2.jpg). You should focus more on the content below than here! Feel free to contact me for collaboration, discussion or just to say hi!

**👣 Current Career**
---

Settled down in University of Virginia, Charlottesville. Charlottesville is a beautiful town of great natural and academical environment. I am now exploring new research directions for my following Ph.D. career. Proposal collaborations are all welcomed.

<!-- During my research period, as an author and a reviewer of Top conferences and journals, I have appreciated the fascination and what I want to do, so I pursue a PhD career further. I am busy with my visa now. -->

**🔍 Research Interests**
---

My research focus on Resource Preserving and ...
<!-- - 🖐️ **Works in hands**. My works are mainly both theoretical analyses and corresponding methods about Efficient AI on Trends, Generative Models, AI Privacy and Safety and Federated Learning. -->
- 🖐️ **Works in hands**. My works are mainly both theoretical analyses and corresponding methods about Resource Preserving. Multi-Modal and Efficiency on Trends. Besides those only collaborative works before my enrollment in UVa that are kept processing, and the other future works and collaboration are in U.S. or other nonsensitive countries.
- 🎓 **Overall background**. A knowledge and research background about math+cs, system/control/information theories, deep learning thoeries, optimization and generalization analyses.
- 🌟 **More-interest**. There is a continuing interest in technical research as well as basic science research. Physics and other science disciplines are always beautiful.
<!-- - **Distributed Learning and Optimization**: -->
<!-- Distributed learning is the last one I majored in. The works explore the heterogeneity composition in federated learning primarily from the perspective of information composition, with methods towards information theory and optimization. -->
<!-- - **Efficient AI**: -->
<!-- Efficient AI is the recent major engagements and expected future major directions. To improve efficiency, especially training, in AI applications, the works in hands are mainly about data-centric AI and optimization. -->
<!-- - **Generative Model**: -->
<!-- Works about Generative Model interest me the most recently. The big hitter, generative model well-supported by diffusion theory, bring me back to the wonders of physics. A theoretically grounded approach is always fascinating. -->
<!-- - **AI Safety and Privacy**: -->
<!-- Another big hitter, LLM, and its practical generation tasks are also of my interests. A lot of industrial issues that need to be solved, effiicency, human value alignment and privacy. -->
