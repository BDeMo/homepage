This paper presents Ferret, a comprehensive framework designed to enhance *online accuracy* of Online Continual Learning (OCL) algorithms while dynamically adapting to varying memory budgets.Ferret employs a fine-grained pipeline parallelism strategy combined with an iterative gradient compensation algorithm, ensuring seamless handling of high-frequency data with minimal latency, and effectively counteracting the challenge of stale gradients in parallel training. To adapt to varying memory budgets, its automated model partitioning and pipeline planning optimizes performance regardless of memory limitations.
